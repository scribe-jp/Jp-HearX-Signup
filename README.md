# HearX - Techincal Test

![HearX Submit Form](./images/HearX.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## Build with
* css
* html
* javascript

## How to run
Simply double click on the index.html

## Notes
* I decided to try and attempt this without using libraries or frameworks.
* It was alot of fun creating.
* I did not complete the loading animation. The code was not working as it should. I got it to work, but it did not go through the validation.
* I also decided to use a dropdown rather than the radio button. The dropdown design looked much more coherent to the rest of the design than radio buttons. I could not get the radio buttons to look as modern as the rest of the boxes. So I decided to use radio boxes.
